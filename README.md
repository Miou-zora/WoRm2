# WoRm2

Recreation of [WoRm](https://github.com/Miou-zora/WoRm) with [Engine²](https://github.com/EngineSquared/EngineSquared)

To make it work, you need to have the Engine² repository in local and setting the 7th line of the xmake.lua of this project to be the path to the Engine² repository.

It works using this commit of Engine²:
c678049b5a2cf606f8ee483ad706eb616a849503

This is mainly a test project to see how Engine² works at this time and how to use it.
